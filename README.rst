Compile python
==============
Usually you don't want to mess with system packages,
specially if the package in question is python.

Distributions usually patch python in a way that may not work together with your app.

On those occasions rather than replacing the version provided by your distribution is usually better to compile your own.

*And that's what this ansible playbook is for!*

Installs all necessary tools to build and install Python and then installs
any given version of Python.

So far Python 2.4, 2.6, 2.7 and 3.5 are supported,
plus installing system dependencies to install (not done in this role):

- pillow
- lxml

Adding support for other version should be trivial,
pull requests welcome.

For ease of usage an easy to remember symlink is provided for each python version,
i.e. ``/srv/python27``, ``/srv/python35`` and so on.

Requirements
============
None

Example Playbook
================
::

        - gforcada.compile-python
      vars:
